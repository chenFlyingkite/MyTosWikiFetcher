Comment :

1. Good contribution on implementing two major features of PHDI, LightHits and Surreal Art. Both of them are required solid understanding on GPUImage framework. You were aggressive and were working very hard for this technical challenge to deliver them on time.

2. Please consider to do more practices to clearly explain the architecture of your code to other members. It would be very helpful to the technical discussion and you can learn more ideas from other members.

3. Let's take care your health state and keep positive attitude on every challenge.

4. Your second part of recharge for UX is not completed yet and you did not book time to do it. This is bad.

5. Thank you for your open mind to support FaceMe Fintech project. It is also your show time to show that you can develop both Android project and iOS project. This is amazing!
